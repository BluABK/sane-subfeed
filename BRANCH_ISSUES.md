This branch (kitteh_changes) cannot be merged to master due to the following unresolved issues:

- Text ellision breaks; It only reacts to UTF-8 titles...
- UTF-8 text isn't displayed in line with ASCII (a bit lower than ASCII "top").
- Issue with font being somewhat condensed and less readable.
- VideoTile label text bleeds onto n+1 line (if you limit title box height then UTF-8 ones break).
